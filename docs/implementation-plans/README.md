# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for HSES protocol commands and features.

## Available Plans

- [0x84 Cycle Mode Switching Command](./0x84-cycle-mode-switching-command.md) - Step / Cycle / Continuous Switching Command

## Plan Structure

Each implementation plan document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the command/feature
2. **Command Specification** - HSES protocol details
3. **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step implementation details
4. **Implementation Order** - Recommended sequence
5. **Testing Strategy** - Unit and integration test plans
6. **Status** - Progress tracking
7. **Related Files** - Files that will be created or modified

## Usage

These plans serve as:
- Development roadmaps for implementing new commands
- Reference documentation for understanding command specifications
- Progress tracking for implementation status
- Testing guidelines for validation

## Contributing

When creating new implementation plans:

1. Follow the established document structure
2. Include comprehensive command specifications
3. Provide detailed implementation steps
4. Include testing strategies
5. Update this README with new plan references
