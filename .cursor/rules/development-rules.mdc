# Moto-HSES Rust Client Library Development Rules

## Development Approach

This project implements features step by step, ensuring that unit tests pass at each stage of development.

## Incremental Implementation Principle

- Run unit tests after each step completion and ensure all tests pass
- If tests fail, do not proceed to the next step until fixes are complete
- For testing, refer to `.cursor/commands/run-all-tests.md`
- **CRITICAL**: Always run `cargo clippy --all-features --workspace` to resolve warnings
- **CRITICAL**: Always run `cargo fmt` to standardize code formatting

## Specification Reference Priority

When there are unclear points, refer to specifications in the following order:

1. `docs/design/protocol-commands.md` - HSES Protocol Command Reference
2. `docs/design/architecture.md` - Architecture Design
3. `docs/specs/hses-protocol.md` - HSES Protocol Specification

## Code Quality Rules

**See**: `.cursor/rules/coding-standards.mdc` for detailed coding standards and quality rules.
